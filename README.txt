Hi Dan,

Here are 4 example pages for the website plus a blank template. I have tried my best to stick to the code found on www.hadrian.tk but some of the changes were quite radical.

Some things to note:

I didn't edit the current style sheet, only added a new one (newstyle3.css, which should probably be renamed).

I have added some example book images, including one to display when there isn't an image available.

I used Font Awesome (see line 14 of the code for each page) to quickly get an example shopping cart symbol, but if CS-Cart provides an alternative that would be better. It's a bit overkill to have a whole font there just for one symbol. 

Any Javascript you see is not mine, I just left it there from the original code.

I hope that's all clear enough!
Thanks,
Tim
